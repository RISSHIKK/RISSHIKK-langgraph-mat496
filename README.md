All that I have learnt from the course "Foundation: Introduction to LangGraph" by academy.langchain.com

# Module 1

**Video 1 - Motivation:**  
    The video explains that while traditional language model workflows (called chains) are reliable, theyâ€™re often too rigid. LangGraph was created to bring more flexibility, allowing developers to define reliable parts of the process while letting the LLM make dynamic decisions when needed, therefore it helps build smarter, more adaptable AI agents.
